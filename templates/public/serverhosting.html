<h1>Hosting Servers</h1>

<h2>Using Online Mode / Verify Names</h2>

<p>
    Online-mode for old servers has been abandoned by Mojang, and has been broken until now.
    Online-Mode is a great way to keep your servers secure, the way Mojang used to do it.
    There are modded servers out there capable of running in online-mode, these are compatible with Mine Online.
    <br/><br/>
    The easiest way to host a server in online-mode is to host it through Mine Online using this command:
    <code>java -cp MineOnline.jar gg.codie.mineonline.Server (server.jar) [launch arguments]</code>
    <br/>
    It's that simple, when you host a server through Mine Online, you can set online-mode or verify-names in the sever.properties file to true, and players using Mine Online or online-mode mods will be able to join.
</p>

<h2>Listing your Server</h2>
<p>
    There are a few ways to add a server to the list. All of them add live player lists.
    In all cases, servers can be named using "server-name" in the server.properties file.<br/>
    You can also list a specific ip, port or domain name using the "serverlist-ip" and "serverlist-port" properties.
    <ol>
        <li><b>Using Mine Online</b></li>
        <p>
            If you host any server through mine online, from c0.0.15a to release 1.16 (or whatever the latest version is ðŸ˜›), by default it will be added to the server list.
            <br/>
            You can opt-out of this by setting public to false in the server properties file.
        </p>
        <li>Using the hMod Plugin</li>
        <p>
            If you'd prefer not to host your server using Mine Online, and are running hMod, a plugin is available to list your server.
            <br/>
            <a href="https://github.com/codieradical/MineOnlineBroadcast-hMod/releases/latest/download/MineOnlineBroadcast.jar">Download</a>
        </p>
        <li>Using the Bukkit Plugin</li>
        <p>
            If you'd prefer not to host your server using Mine Online, and are running Bukkit, a plugin is available to list your server.
            <br/>
            <a href="https://github.com/codieradical/MineOnlineBroadcast-Bukkit/releases/latest/download/MineOnlineBroadcast-Bukkit.jar">Download</a>
            <br/>
            To tell Mine Online what version you're running, you'll need to specify the "version-md5" inside your server.properties file.
            <br/>
            The MD5s for various servers can be found <a href="https://github.com/codieradical/MineOnline/tree/master/res/versions/server">here</a> . In the case where there are multiple versions, any one will work.
            <br/>
            For example, a beta 1.7.3 server would use "version-md5=40F36C4EB86E8AC71D965EB0677D4A6F".
